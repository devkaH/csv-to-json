# lab_csv_to_json
The assignment lab for this module is to build a node script to convert CSV files to JSON files.
## Project brief
Write a node script that will convert the customer-data.csv file into a JSON file. The 1st row of the CSV file acts as the keys/properties of the JSON object and the rest of the fields act as values. The JSON file must have an array with 1000 items. Output the JSON file in the same directory and name the file customer-data.json.
